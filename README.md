<!-- INSPIRE E-BOOK -->


<!-- The Inspire E-book Application is a user-friendly platform that facilitates the process of renting books. It offers a seamless experience for both users and administrators, making it convenient to borrow books and manage the rental inventory.

For users, the application provides a user registration and login system. Once logged in, users can browse through a collection of available books. Each book is listed with its details, including title, author, description, and rental price per day. Users can select the desired book(s) and specify the number of days they wish to rent them for.

After making the selection, users can proceed to the checkout process, where they can review the total cost of the rental and provide their preferred payment method. The application ensures secure payment processing.

On the admin side, authorized administrators can log in to the application using their credentials. Once logged in, they have access to an administrative dashboard. From the dashboard, administrators can manage the rental inventory by adding new books, updating book information, and setting the rental price and availability. -->
